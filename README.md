# odin-recipes
Completing the recipes project task on the odin project

This project entails building a basic recipe website, albeit it will look rather brutalist as I've only learned html as of this point, without any CSS and JS however I feel that I've learned key skills that should put me in a good position to get a rough outline and basic website out.

I've learned about closing tags that include anchor tags, unordered lists and paragraphs as well as self-closing tags like meta tags and images
